    <h2>Application Instructions</h2>
    <br>
    RUSTGRIP <sup>®</sup> is a one-part, metallic-filled moisture-cured polyurethane that can be used as a primer, topcoat or to encapsulate. It can be applied to metal, concrete, masonry and wood, as specified.


    <h4><u>Surface must be clean from oil, tar, rust, grease, salts, and films.
    </u></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Use general degreaser if needed.</li>
      <li>Clean surface using TSP(tri-sodium-phosphate) or a
    citrus cleaner to release dirt and degreaser residue.</li>
      <li>Pressure-wash if possible @ 3500 psi.</li>
      <li>Salt contamination on a surface can come as a result of salt water, fertilizers, and car exhaust. Use Chlor-Rid or equivalent to decontaminate surface if salts are present.  Acceptable levels: Nitrates: 5-10 mcg/cm², Sulfates: 5-10 mcg/cm², Chlorides: 3-5 mcg/cm²</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><u>Surface must be completely dry before applying.</u></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>SuperTHERM<sup>®</sup> must be applied during proper temperatures (below) and the prescribed overcoat window of the coating over which it will be applied.</li>
      <li>Maximum Surface Temperature when applying: 150°F(65°C)</li>
      <li>Minimum Surface Temperature when applying: 40°F (5°C)</li>
      <li>Maximum Surface Temperature after curing: 300°F  (149°C) </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li><em>NOTE:</em> Use RUSTGRIP<sup>®</sup> as a primer when needed.  Refer to RUSTGRIP<sup>®</sup> technical data sheet for overcoat window.</li>
      <li><em>NOTE:</em> If pack rust or mill scale exist, it must be removed by grit blast, power tool or needle gun.  Once removed, begin with Step 1 (power wash).</li>

      <li><em>NOTE:</em> Modified bitumen, asphalt roofing and single-ply
        membranes must be primed with the appropriate primer
        (i.e. Super Base/HS or SP Single-Ply Primer).</li>
        <li><em>NOTE:</em> Harsh environments where color is desired, or where pooling may occur:
          <br>
          SuperTHERM<sup>®</sup> should be over coated with ENAMOGRIP<sup>®</sup> (solvent based) over metal or concrete, SP SEAL COAT<sup>®</sup> or SP LIQUID MEMBRANE<sup>®</sup> over flexible surfaces (foam, tar, rubber and wood).</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <p>MIXING
    SuperTHERM<sup>®</sup> should be mechanically mixed or mixed by hand (boxing) for three minutes, then applied.
    </p>
    <h4><u>APPLICATION</u></h4>
    <p>SuperTHERM<sup>®</sup> can be applied by brush, roller or spray; however, the preferred method is by air or airless sprayer. it should never be applied directly over rust, nor should It ever be diluted or thinned.</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>If application is by brush, use a soft bristle brush.</li>
      <li>If application is by roller, use a 3/4 inch nap roller.</li>
      <li>If application is by spray, use a standard airless sprayer
          (2 gallons/minute at 3,300 psi.) with a .029-.033 tip
          according to fan width spread of application and pump
          pressure. To achieve proper thickness, temperature
          and humidity must be considered by applicator.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>NOTE: The number of applications and the thickness of each should be in accordance with the job specifications.</li>
      <li>NOTE: All filters should be removed from both the gun handle and spray machine prior to application,  as they will trap the ceramics.</li>
      <li>NOTE: Temperatures must always be a minimum of 5 degrees above the dew point during application.</li>
      <li>NOTE:  If SuperTHERM<sup>®</sup> is applied during a period of extremely high humidity or if there is rain  soon after the application, bubbles may appear on the surface.  Do not puncture these bubbles. This is normal and the coating will continue to cure with no effect on the performance or appearance of the coating. Bubbles will dry down tight and disappear without a trace or imprint.</li>
      <li>NOTE:  2" corrugation = roof size x 135%; 2.5" corrugation = roof size x 145%; 3" corrugation = roof size x 160%</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>MINIMUM SPREAD RATES (mil thickness)</h4>
    <p>
      SuperTHERM<sup>®</sup> will be applied at no less than a total of 17 mils wet(425 microns)/9 mils dry (229 microns) for each  application. Spread Rate is 95 sq ft per gallon. (8.7 sq meter per gallon)
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>CURE TIME</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>30-60 minutes to tack free at 70°F (21°C)</li>
      <li>Overcoat: 2 hours when 70°F (21°C) at 40% Relative Humidity</li>
      <li>Full Cure: 21 days at above conditions.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h4>TEMPERATURE</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Apply between 40°F and 100°F</li>
      <li>Store between 40°F and 100°F</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h4>Store between 40°F and 100°F</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>After completion, spray system should be cleaned with
    soap and water; cleaned brushes and rollers can be
    reused.</li>
    </ol>

      <h2>RustGRIP<sup>®</sup><sub>(clear)</sub></h2>
        <p>Enhancement of insulation effect from residential to INDUSTRIAL and everything in between!</p>

        <p>RustGRIP<sup>®</sup> is a unique single component combination of high performance aliphatic urethanes, elastomeric acrylics, standard acrylics and resin additives in a water borne formula. No co-solvents are present and will dry by evaporation. Due to the unique combination of acrylics and urethanes, RustGRIP ® cures out completely in 14 - 21 days to an extremely tough, durable, non-yellowing, water resistant coating that also provides flexibility, water proofing and UV stability. RustGRIP ® has passed 2000 hours of salt spray testing which equals marine specifications and in fact has DNV certification.</p>

        <p>RustGRIP<sup>®</sup> was built to meet the requirements of industrial uses which required a tough surface, and provide flexibility against stresses of contraction and expansion. Also, unlike all other "reflective" paints on the market which offer only a single reflective ceramic to provide heat reflection, RustGRIP ® is designed with four separate ceramic compounds for insulation from radiant heat, reflection, conduction and convection. RustGRIP ® ceramics are not the rough multifaceted type as the one found   in other coatings. </p>

      <h2>EMISSIVITY EXPLAINED & DEMONSTRATED</h2>
        <p>Therefore, RustGRIP ® is a true " insulating " coating and not just a reflective paint as are all the competing formulas in the market. Also tested by the Thermo Physical Research Laboratory for comparative R19 equivalent insulation factor RustGRIP ® blocked 92% of the heat. No other R19 equivalent insulator can claim that! No Fiberglass, No Foam, No Cellulose, No other single ceramic paint!</p>

        <p>RUST GRIP COATING FOR HARSH ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION
          The difference between a surface coating and RUSTGRIP! ®
          A surface coating does not have the special solvent carrier to allow it to enter the pores of a substrate and carry the body of the coating into the pores with it. The surface coating will bite into anything above the pore area and adhere to the surface by attaching to any roughness. This works well in most areas until the surface of the coating is exposed to weathering and other elements over time allowing oxidation and acid rain to enter through its pin holes and begin the migration of corrosion.</p>

    <h3>RustGRIP ® ADDRESSES ALL THREE MODES OF HEAT TRANSFER!
  REPELS RADIATED HEAT ~ REFLECTS CONVECTED HEAT ~ RESISTS CONDUCTED HEAT</h3>
  </section>

    <div class="main-parallax right rustgrip-3">
      <h2>~ The first ceramic compound is primarily to block Ultra Violet (UV) heat at 99%.</h2>

      <p>

        ~ The second ceramic repels better than 92% of Visual Light (short wave) heat.

        ~ The third ceramic compound is to stop 92% of heat and / or cold conduction by hollow sphere technology which is not glass.

        ~ The fourth ceramic compound is designed specifically for stopping infrared radiated heat. This ceramic blocks 99.5% of Infrared Radiation ( long wave ) to control the heat gain or loss to the envelope of buildings or equipment. This new compound was introduced in February of 2000 as part of our continued research in controlling heat transfer.

        From the BOB VILA blog "The Dean of Home Renovation & Repair Advice"
        "Ceramic Coatings for Increased Insulation"

        - The combination of acrylics provide elasticity and adhesion while the urethane adds toughness, binds the acrylics and compounds and also provides a moisture barrier. The fourth resin additive is what makes the complete resin blend to combine into a single component and extends the life of the coating. This resin / ceramic combination has been shown to repel both heat and fire, withstand elements for 30 to 40 years, endure a 180 degree bend without cracking, resist water, acid rain and ultraviolet light. RustGRIP ® is a permanently flexible "breathable" membrane that stops water penetration and prevents corrosion and surface deterioration.

      <p>Reduction of BTU conduction through a steel plate from 367.2 to 3.99 at a thickness of 10 mils DFT ( 8/1000 " ) This               reduction is written for steel, concrete or any other substrate material. The combination of reflectivity, emissivity and thermal conductivity equals R19 ( ASTM C236 )
      </p>
      <p>
        "R" Value improvement ratio: The ASTM C236 test verified that using RustGRIP ® over an existing "R" value material will enhance the total of the "R" value performance of the system. The control fiber glass board tested to K=0.52. When RustGRIP ® was applied at the standard 10 mils dry, the certified improvement to the "R" value was 68% . One coat each at 10 mils of RustGRIP ® applied to opposite sides of the same "R" rated material improved the "R" performance by 148%. Therefore, based upon the 68% improvement ratio, a minimum of R13 material or system can be improved to R21.8 by applying one coat of RustGRIP ®.</p>

      <p> FEATURE
